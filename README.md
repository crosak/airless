## Modelling of Bare Rock Emission Spectra

*airless* is a code developed to model a bare rock (or a very thin atmosphere) scenario, accounting for the characteristics of a given surface profile's interaction with electromagnetic radiation, assuming no significant heat redistribution. It can be used either as a forward model to produce planetary emission spectra or in inference mode to retrieve planetary reflectance characteristics.
